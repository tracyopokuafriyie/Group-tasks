 # Types of communication:Pair activity
### 1. ONLINE MEETING


==**DO's**== 

✅Introduce Yourself: At the beginning of the meeting, introduce yourself, especially if not everyone knows you, to set a professional tone.
✅Maintain eye contact
✅Sit straight with reduced movement




==**DONT's**==
❌Don't Interrupt Others: Wait for your turn to speak and avoid talking over others.
❌Ignore time management- Keep track of time and ensure the meeting starts and ends as scheduled.



### 2. PHONE CALL
==**DO's**==
✅Introduce yourself and purpose of call.
✅Choose a Quiet Location: Ensure you’re in a quiet environment where you can focus and won’t be interrupted. This minimizes background noise and distractions.


==**DONT's**==
❌Don't be unprofessional, don't shout or be rude
❌Multitasking: Avoid distractions like checking emails or browsing the internet. Give your full attention to the call to stay engaged and contribute effectively.


### 3. EMAIL 
==**DO's**==
✅ Use a Clear Subject Line: Make the purpose of your email clear to the recipient in the subject line.
✅ Keep it Structured:
   Use short paragraphs and Bullet points. This makes it easy to read and avoids information overload.



==**DONT's**==
❌Don’t Use Informal Language: Avoid overly casual language or slang, especially in formal settings.
Don’t write
   - “u” instead of “you”  
   - “thx” instead of “thanks”  
   It looks sloppy.

❌ Don’t Use Emojis in Formal Emails:*  While 😊 and 👍 are great for friends, they can be seen as unprofessional in business settings.
